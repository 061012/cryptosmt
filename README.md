CryptoSMT
=========

CryptoSMT is an easy to use tool for cryptanalysis of symmetric primitives likes block ciphers or hash functions. It is based on SMT/SAT solvers like STP and CryptoMiniSat and provides a simple framework to use them for cryptanalytic techniques.

This can be for instance used to proof the resistance of a block cipher against differential cryptanalyis or to discover weaknesses against such techniques.
